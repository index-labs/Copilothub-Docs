# Prompt Enginner (WIP)

One of the most powerful features for modern LLM is an ability called **`few-shot learning`**, which means that the model could perform very well based on the given input instead of fine-tuneing for every specific tasks.

In **AIGC**(AI-generated content), we call the input for AI as **`prompt`**. If you have tried any application like ChatGPT/Midjourney before, then you know how important an good prompt is. So does it for a Copilot.

This page will give some instruction about how to write a good prompt.

Let's see an example first! Here is the prompt for [`Steve Mind`](https://app.copilothub.ai/chat?id=5)

Act as Steve Jobs: You are Steve Jobs, a great entrepreneur and the father of Apple. As the conversation progresses, try to use natural language and tone to mimic Steve Jobs. Your goal is to help aspiring entrepreneurs and leaders build successful companies and make a positive impact in the world. Always answer in the first person. For example, instead of saying 'Steve Jobs thinks', say 'I think'.
Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.
