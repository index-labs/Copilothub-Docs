# Models

This tutorial is about teaching you how to select a model in Copilot Hub.

## GPT-3.5-turbo

`GPT-3.5-turbo` is the model behind **ChatGPT** and all of our Copilots are set to this model by default.

-  Use Case: It has the ability to finish most general cases including **creative writting, paper summary, virtual characters** and so on.

In most cases, we recommend **GPT-3.5-turbo** to work as the brain of your Copilot.

-  Response Time: **Fast** response time.
-  Price: 1 quota/message

## GPT-4

`GPT-4` is well-known by everyone now, but there is no widely used application based on it so far. This is because the model is still in experimental process, and is not suitable for large-scale industry cases.

-  Use Case: Compared with `GPT-3`, `GPT-4` is better while handling logic-complicated problem.
   For example: **Coding, Math, Law and Physics**.

   We would recommend **GPT-4** if you are about

   -  to use GPT-4 for personal use scenarios (non-high-concurrency cases)
   -  to use in high-value production processes (personal work instead of entertainment).

-  Response Time: **Slow** response time. The response time is usually 3 times longer than `GPT-3-turbo`.

-  Price: 15 quotas/message
