# What is a Copilot

Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that can help you complete specific tasks. For example, it can act as a digital character, coding assistant, legal consultant, and much more. With Copilot, you can achieve more in less time and collaborate with others more effectively.

## Type of Copilot

There are 2 kinds of copilots in Copilot Hub right now, which are **Data Copilot** and **Prompt Copilot**.

### Data Copilot

Data Copilot provides users with ability of creating an AI based on personal data, i.e. upload your own data while creating, and then the Copilot will give response based on these spefic knowledge.

This way your Copilot is more `personalized`, but also needs high-quality data to perform well.

### Prompt Copilot

Prompt Copilot is an `easier` way to create a Copilot. This way you don't need to upload any data, you can create a powerful robot just by filling up some description and a system prompt to Copilot. If you are seeking for a general solution like coding assistant, creative-writor and virtual pets, then Prompt Copilot would be a better choice.
